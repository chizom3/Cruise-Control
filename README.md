# Cruise-Control
The need to reduce vehicle road traffic accident and improve fuel efficiency of vehicles
has given rise to more research on intelligent transportation system. This research has
resulted in the development of adaptive cruise control (ACC) which improves driver and
passenger comfort as well as safety. The ACC system operates in two modes which are
distance and speed control method. The speed control method works like the conventional
cruise control where the speed is the main priority while for the distance control method,
the vehicle tends to ensure that it keeps a safe distance between the vehicle in front.
In this project, the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle was modeled for the ACC algorithm.
The vehicle model comprises of the engine, the wheel dynamics, the traction model and
the load distribution around the vehicle. The controller used was the conventional PID
controller to control the vehicle. The ACC algorithm ensures that the vehicle maintains
a safe distance between the vehicle in front by adopting the speed of the vehicle when
the distance between them is below the threshold distance. The system was simulated
for different conditions and the result that was obtained showed that the ACC system can
improve road safety by adjusting the vehicles speed based on the distance between both
vehicles.
